# Lab4: Using Analog to Digital Convertor (ADC)

ACTIVITY-1
          						Min				           			     Max
				    Raw 			     Scaled 			     Raw 	        		Scaled
VR1				0x0000				    0	           0xE9D2			        301					
VR2				0x0000				    0	           0xE94D	        		300	 


The answer for activity-1 is also included in the main.c file at the top. The modified code can complete all these requirements of ACTIVITY-2 and ACTIVITY-3:
The shield LEDs flash together (i.e. all on or all off).
The on time is controlled by VR1.
The off time is controlled by VR2.
The maximum on time or off time is 3 seconds.
The minimum on time or off time is 0.5 seconds.
Shield button B1 turns the system on and off.
When the system is off, the red LED (on the development board) lights. When the system is on, the green LED (on the development board) lights.
